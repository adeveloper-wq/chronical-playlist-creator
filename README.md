# Chronical Playlist Creator
- With this application you can create a playlist that contains all the songs added in a given time period to other playlists.
- made with React

## Local Development
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

## Disclaimer
- code really needs refactoring and optimization
- made this with very little experience in React and a strong focus on features instead of clean and reusable code
